Title: Wall Art Drawing Bot

As part of my Engineering Exploration course, I worked on a project titled Wall Art Drawing Bot, which aimed to combine robotics and art in a functional and creative way. The objective of the project was to automate the process of drawing intricate patterns and images on a wall using a robotic system.

The bot was designed using servo motors for precise movement and a pen-based drawing mechanism to ensure accuracy. I contributed to the mechanical design and was involved in programming the motion control system to accurately translate digital images into physical wall drawings.

Through effective teamwork and iterative development, we successfully developed a functional prototype that demonstrated both innovation and practicality. The project attracted significant attention for its unique integration of engineering and creativity.

The project was showcased at the Prayog Varsh 2023 design exhibition, where it won First Prize, highlighting our ability to apply engineering principles creatively and deliver impactful solutions.
